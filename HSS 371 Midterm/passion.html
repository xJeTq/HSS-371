            <h2>Why I Chose Google Glass</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">I've selected Google Glass as the focal point of my project because I am particularly fascinated by its peculiar path in the technology industry. Google Glass is a wearable smart glasses product developed by Google, initially introduced as a concept in 2012. It featured a heads-up display, camera, and voice recognition, but faced privacy concerns and was discontinued for consumers in 2015, shifting its focus to enterprise applications.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The technology, while not achieving widespread commercial success, has had a profound influence on both the wearable technology industry and society's perceptions of such innovations. The most pivotal shortcoming of Google Glass was the concerns revolving around its privacy and security. Although this is a major aspect of emerging technologies to consider, it brought further discussion of other privacy concerns in the technology industry. The device's role in shaping the trajectory of wearable technology and its impact on future inventions are what makes it the perfect subject to analyze.</p>
