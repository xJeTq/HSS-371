            <h2>Why I Chose Google Glass</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">I've selected Google Glass as the focal point of my project because I am particularly intrigued by its unique trajectory in the world of technology. Google Glass is a wearable smart glasses product developed by Google, initially introduced as a concept in 2012. It featured a heads-up display, camera, and voice recognition, but faced privacy concerns and was discontinued for consumers in 2015, shifting its focus to enterprise applications. The technology, while not achieving widespread commercial success, has had a profound influence on both the wearable technology industry and society's perceptions of such innovations. It represents an intriguing case study of a pioneering technology that faced challenges in adoption and privacy concerns, yet managed to spark important conversations about the future of augmented reality and human-computer interaction.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>By choosing Google Glass, I aim to delve into the nuanced story of its importance and societal impact despite its shortcomings as a consumer product. The device's role in shaping the trajectory of wearable technology and its impact on future inventions make it a compelling subject for analysis. Through this project, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how breakthrough technologies can leave a lasting legacy, even when they do not achieve their initial market goals.</p>
