This is my final project for HSS 371 (Computers & Society). I recreated _Asteroids_ in Unity.

To view the project, the files are too big to upload to Github. So, here is the Google Drive folder, free for download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yWRNs-fzqpj1XnF-ALz8OTk_Da_24Yon?usp=sharing__

I also made a webpage to download the game I made. Here is the link for that: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xJeTq/HSS-371/final/Website/index.html
